A Constant Exercise of Letting Variables Be Variables

Imagine that you are building an application to manage a user's Facebook profile. 
A profile might have a 'name', 'age', and 'dateOfBirth'.
Declare three variables with these same names, making sure to use 'const' or 'let' depending on 
whether you expect the value to change over time.
